#  Stock Performance Recommender using LSTM and Sentiment Analysis

This project combines historical financial data and sentiment analysis from financial news to recommend top-performing stocks. It uses a dual-model system — an LSTM-based financial model and a FinBERT-based sentiment classifier — to score stocks and filter them by sector and risk.

##  How to Run the Code

1. Upload the following two folders into your Colab runtime:
   - `financial.zip` — contains yearly financial data CSVs
   - `senti.zip` — contains sentiment-labeled financial news

2. Run the notebook from top to bottom.

3. If you encounter the error:  
   `ValueError: numpy.dtype size changed, may indicate binary incompatibility...`  
   ➤ Restart the runtime and re-run the notebook.

##  Project Pipeline

1. Financial Model (LSTM)
   - Processes 5-year sequences of company financials.
   - Trains a Bidirectional LSTM model with attention.
   - Outputs a financial performance score.

2. Sentiment Model
   - Uses FinBERT to classify financial news as Positive, Neutral, or Negative.
   - Predicts sentiment scores per stock based on matched articles.

3. Score Aggregation
   - Final score = 80% financial + 20% sentiment.
   - Risk score is calculated from downside volatility and leverage metrics.

4. Stock Recommender
   - Built using Gradio.
   - Filters stocks by sector and risk level.
   - Displays top 10 stocks by final score.

##  Visualizations

Plots generated by the notebook include:
- LSTM training/validation loss and accuracy
- Sentiment model training curves
- Confusion matrices and ROC curves for both models

These can be found in the Results section of the PDF report.

## Known Bugs
- (Restart and Run all) command causes session to time out. Please run each cell individually
- Occasional dtype error — resolved by restarting runtime.
- Occasional ValueError during training - resolved by restarting runtime
- Gradio might require re-launching if runtime times out.
